Revision history for Posy-Plugin-Info
=====================================

0.04 Fri 15 July 2005
---------------------

  * (15 Jul 2005) sort by parameter
  	This enhancement allows one to sort the entries dynamically, by
  giving a parameter; this facility isn't turned on until the parmeter
  name is defined in the config.

0.0301 Fri 15 July 2005
-----------------------

  * (15 Jul 2005) formatting of docs

0.03 Wed 13 July 2005
---------------------

  * (13 Jul 2005) info_type_spec
  	Made a separate info_type_spec which gives the type information
  about the info fields separate from the info_sort_spec information.
  This is useful for (a) not having to repeat the information every time
  you want to give a different sort order, (b) other plugins wanting to
  use that information.
  	This has made the plugin dependent on Posy::Plugin::YamlConfig.
